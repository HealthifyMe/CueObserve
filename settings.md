## Slack

CueObserve can send two types of Slack alerts:

1. Anomaly alerts are sent when an anomaly is detected
2. App Monitoring alerts are sent when an anomaly detection job fails

To get these alerts, enter your Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token. To create a Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token, follow the steps outlined in [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

1. Create a slack app.
2. Once you create the app, you will be redirected to your appâ€™s `Basic Information` screen. In `Add features and functionality`, click on `Bots`.
3. On the next screen, click on `add a scope` and you will be redirected to OAuth & Permissions page.
4. On the next screen, go to Scopes section, click on `Add on OAuth Scope` and  add `files:write` and `chat:write` permissions, now click on `Install to Workspace` to create the `Bot User OAuth Token` .
5. Copy `Bot User OAuth Token` and paste it in the CueObserve Settings screen.

Next, create two channels in Slack. Add the app to these two channels. 

1. To find your Slack channel's ID, right-click the channel in Slack and then click on `Open channel details` . You'll find the channel ID at the bottom. Copy and paste it in the CueObserve Settings screen.
2. Click on the `Save` button.
